# A simple blackjack game in python

Nothing too complicated, I thought through the UX, should be just fine :>

Soon there will be a lot more tho, I plan on adding some fun stuff like a shop where you can buy different stuff o(*￣▽￣*)ブ

Thank you, for writing the Unit tests and commit messages, Claude Sonnet 4!
