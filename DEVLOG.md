The point is to create a simple blackjack game written in Python.

I personally don't understand dev logs so I'm just gonna have my thoughts here lol.
Turns out I know way less python than I thought I did-

I just ran into a bug, I tried run&debug... The 8 ball first said "What do you think?" then it said "Try ALT+F4"-

## Plan

1. Create a deck of cards
2. Shuffle the deck
3. Deal two cards to the player and the dealer
4. Implement the game logic for hitting and standing
5. Determine the winner
